# NLCD + ACS

To avoid having to download all raw data and compute the NLCD to ACS Census Tract join, download the [processed.zip](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dt3c3uhpmgz2u2u/processed.zip?dl=0) file and unzip it into the `data/` directory. As a sanity check, after you do this, the file `data/processed/acs_5yr_2011_nlcd_joined_data.csv` should exist.
